# Comparison of Different Methods of Training Word Embeddings

Different methods of training word embeddings were compared. We tried out to train word embeddings by explicit and implicit co-occurence matrix factorization. Also we trained word embeddings by direct optimization of the objective via Riemannian optimization framework. The comprehensive  can be found here: Team 8 Final Project Report.pdf
