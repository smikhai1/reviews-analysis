# Comparison of Different Methods of Training Word Embeddings

The goal of this project was to compare different methods of training word embeddings for sentiment analysis of users' reviews in online markets. We tried out to train word embeddings by explicit and implicit co-occurence matrix factorization. Also we trained word embeddings by direct optimization of the objective via Riemannian optimization framework.
